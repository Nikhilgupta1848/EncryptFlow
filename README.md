# EncryptFlow

EncryptFlow is a web application built using Flask, designed to demonstrate encryption and decryption of messages using the Caesar Cipher technique. This app allows users to encrypt a message with a Caesar Cipher, send it through a queue, and decrypt the message using the same shift value.

## Features

- **Message Encryption**: Encrypt any message with a Caesar Cipher using a user-defined shift.
- **Message Decryption**: Retrieve encrypted messages from the queue and decrypt them using the same shift value.
- **Queue Management**: Messages are queued after encryption and can be retrieved for decryption.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python (Flask) for server-side logic and API handling.
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the user interface and asynchronous operations.
- **Encryption**: Caesar Cipher for message encryption and decryption.
